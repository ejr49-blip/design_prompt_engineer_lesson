## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1. Bauhaus
2. Swiss Style
3. New Wave Typography

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1. Exact founding year and founder
2. Exact time period of peak influence
3. Why designers rejected Swiss objectivity

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1. Asymmetry
2. Functionalism
3. Modernism

## PINNED: CONCEPT MAP

```
Bauhaus (1919–1933)
→ Focus on unifying art, craft, and technology
→ Emphasis on function over ornament
→ Use of geometric forms and simplified typography
→ Foundation for modernist design thinking

Swiss Style (1950s–1970s)
→ Systematizes modernist ideas into formal rules
→ Grid systems as organizing principle
→ Sans-serif typography and asymmetrical layouts
→ Objective, neutral visual communication

New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)
→ Reaction against Swiss Style rigidity
→ Breaks grid systems intentionally
→ Typography becomes expressive and layered
→ Aligns with postmodern ideas and cultural experimentation

Relationship Between Movements
Bauhaus introduces modernist principles →
Swiss Style formalizes them into strict systems →
New Wave challenges the idea that neutrality and order are always desirable

## PINNED: CONFUSIONS AND BOUNDARIES

```
Swiss Style is not just minimalism; it is a structured communication system built on rules and grids.

Bauhaus is not a graphic design style alone; it is a broader philosophy that influenced many disciplines.

New Wave Typography is not the same as Grunge; New Wave experiments with typography conceptually, while Grunge emphasizes texture and disorder.

Lack of legibility in New Wave design is often intentional, not a failure of design.

## DECISIONS

| Decision | New Wave Typography — chosen because it directly reacts to Swiss Style’s grid-based objectivity and clearly demonstrates a conceptual shift rather than just a visual trend. |
|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | [New Wave / Grunge — pick one, say why] |
| Expert for critique | [Name — say why this expert for this card] |

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
I originally believed Swiss Style was mainly an aesthetic preference for cleanliness, but learned it was a disciplined system designed to remove personal expression from communication.

I assumed experimental typography was careless or decorative; research showed that movements like New Wave used disruption intentionally to challenge cultural and design norms.
